I tried to recall the interval based on familiarity. Some intervals I have melodies to help me remember (the tritone in Rush's \\YYZ\\).  I began the second task in a similar way by singing the 3 notes repeatedly while labeling intervals. But everytime I heard the first note my do would shift to match it. To compensate I included the original do when I sang enabling me to hear the played pitches all as intervals to one another starting with do.  I repeated the method for the third task but the sequence length was becoming an issue. I was forgetting some intervals and my do was occasionally slipping.  By the fourth and fifth task I couldn't keep up with the intervals. On nearly all of the tasks I lost the orignal do. Since there were too many notes to memorize so rapidly I focused on the sequence's behavior. I listened for whether the sequences was rising or falling and by how much.\}","{\Q0\:\These tasks enlightened me of my own strengths and weaknesses.
