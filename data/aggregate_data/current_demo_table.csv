I tried to recall the interval based on familiarity. Some intervals I have melodies to help me remember (the tritone in Rush's \\YYZ\\).  I began the second task in a similar way by singing the 3 notes repeatedly while labeling intervals. But everytime I heard the first note my do would shift to match it. To compensate I included the original do when I sang enabling me to hear the played pitches all as intervals to one another starting with do.  I repeated the method for the third task but the sequence length was becoming an issue. I was forgetting some intervals and my do was occasionally slipping.  By the fourth and fifth task I couldn't keep up with the intervals. On nearly all of the tasks I lost the orignal do. Since there were too many notes to memorize so rapidly I focused on the sequence's behavior. I listened for whether the sequences was rising or falling and by how much.\}","{\Q0\:\These tasks enlightened me of my own strengths and weaknesses. They also showed me how all music melody and harmony is based off of intervals. While analyzing the data it may be interesting to see how close the answeres are relative to the previous answer. I think got some of the sequences right but starting on a wrong note.\}","{\Q0\:\Nothing except my voice\}","{\Q0\:\Headphones\}","{\Q0\:\Male\}","{\Q0\:\Yes\}"

It was really hard when the melody didn't confirm the key however; I could usually come up with a new key to justify the pattern or way of thinking about it (sometimes as a set of very local relationships) but it took longer and the more I had to think about it to come up with a framework for chunking the more it interfered with my ability to simultaneously retain the melody.\}","{\Q0\:\\}","{\Q0\:\No\}","{\Q0\:\Computer speakers\}","{\Q0\:\Male\}","{\Q0\:\Yes\}"
