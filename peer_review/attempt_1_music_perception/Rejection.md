Associate Editor Comments to Author:

Dear Dr. Baker,

I have now received three reviews of your paper “MP-2020-0086 - Frequently Occurring Melodic Patterns are Easier to Recall”.

All reviewers are experts in the domains covered by your research. As you can see below, they see interest and merit in your work, but also point out numerous concerns, with some of them being more important than could be addressed by a revision. These points cover not only the presentation of your study including its integration in previous research, but also hypotheses, methods, results, analyses and interpretation.

I would like to thank all three reviewers for their careful reading, listed questions and numerous propositions to improve the presentation of your study as well as to improve your research line. I will not reiterate their comments here, but recommend that you carefully study each of them.

While I generally prefer giving authors the opportunity to revise and improve their manuscript and their research, the current weaknesses do indeed surpass the possibilities of a simple revision. I am thus sorry to not being able to bring more positive news, but the comments of the reviewers should still be helpful for your research line development.

Thank you for considering Music Perception as an outlet for your present and future work,

Best regards,

Barbara Tillmann

One experiment was conducted to examine the paradoxical finding that melodies are relatively easy to remember even though they are quite difficult to encode.  
Whereas many experiments have examined how well subjects remember previously encoded melodies, the current experiment focused on the encoding process.  
More specifically, the experiment was designed to assess whether certain melodic features would make some melodies easier to encode than others. In the experiment trained listeners were asked to recall novel note patterns between 1 and 9 notes long.  
The results demonstrated that frequently occurring melodies were easier to recall than less frequently occurring melodies.  
The authors argue that the results demonstrate that musical structure predicts memorability above and beyond the length of the melody and suggests areas for future research regarding which melody structures promote or interfere with encoding.

On page 6: I did not understand the argument about how working memory capacity contaminates conclusions in previous studies on melody recognition.  
The authors should provide a clearer explanation of the problem or eliminate this consideration from the manuscript.

General results: It appears that accuracy was defined as the number of correct notes within a given trial.  
If that is true then the frequency finding would indicate that listeners tended to recall more of a melody that included more frequent notes, 
but not necessarily that people recalled the most frequent notes of the melody.  
In fact, listeners could be recalling the anomalous notes and ‘filling in’ the rest on the basis of schema-driven reconstruction.

Hypothesis I predicts that there will be a significant direct correlation between frequency of occurrence and memorability.  
Can the authors eliminate the possibility that people would tend to guess more frequently occurring responses even if they didn’t ‘remember’ them?  
This is another version of the schema-driven reconstruction issue raised in the previous paragraph.  
I also wonder if the authors could look at whether the strength of the relationship between frequency and recallability increased later in the experiment.  
Presumably, the subjects would have been more familiar with the corpus’ structure later in the experiment so this feels like a reasonable prediction given Hypothesis I. 

With regard to Hypothesis II, I think the results section should include more text to orient the reader to Figures III and IV.  
I had to do a lot of work to extract an interpretation from the figures.

With regard to Hypothesis III, I was a little unclear about what the ‘number of notes’ model prediction was.  
Is it that fewer notes would be more easily recalled?  
That people could recall as many as 7 plus or minus 2?  
Given that all of the melodies were within the range of 7 plus or minus 2, I’m not sure what this model predicts across the corpus and how it did a poorer job than the other models that were tested.

I think it would be helpful to get some more data on overall performance on the task.  
People were above chance in the one-note condition, but how much better than chance?  
And what was performance like in the other conditions?

Paradoxically, I think my overall assessment of the manuscript is that there was both too much and too little to recommend the manuscript for publication in its current form.  
I thought the literature reviewed in the introduction covered too many topics in too little detail.  
I think the literature review needs more focus.  
Similarly, I thought the data analysis and presentation was lacking in detail in spite of the detailed analyses that were performed. 
Too much was left for the reader to try to work out on their own. 

I think this manuscript addressed a very interesting and important question.  
I like the general approach of using recall technique and the various independent variables that the authors brought to bear.  
However, I think the manuscript does not quite make good on the potential of the experiment.

This is a good idea for a study, and it is possible that you have carried it out in a well-controlled and competent way. 
However, it is very difficult from your account, especially in the Method section, to evaluate exactly what happened in the experiment. 
The Method section needs a much more precise description of what happens on each trial. 
At present it refers the reader to Figure 1 which I found extremely difficult to understand. 
We need more explicit details concerning the formation of the sequences, the ordering of keys, etc.
In terms of the Intro and Discussion sections, it seems to me that a major component of the computational models is involved with "tonalness" as you note on p. 26. 
The Intro might well pay more attention to the temporal process of tonal encoding of novel melodies (for example in the work of Dowling & Tillmann, Music Perception, 2014, and Dowling, Magner & Tillmann, Psychomusicology, 2016).
I have a very minor quibble with the reference to "musicians trained in relative pitch aural skills" (p. 33), since to some readers that phrase implies finding pitches by virtue of the succession of pitch intervals. Sticking to the phrase in the Abstract, "trained in moveable-do solfege," is a good idea.

This is a combined behavioral and computational study. 
Using a serial recall task with solfege reporting, the author demonstrates a relationship between frequency of occurrence of scale degrees and accuracy and reaction time of recall. 
The IDyOM model outperformed other models, providing some support for the role of statistical learning in melody recall. 
I applaud the authors for posting all materials on Open Science Framework, but I have a number of concerns with this manuscript.

1. The study purports to address three hypotheses. 
The first hypothesis is that scale degree predicts recall. 
The author finds support for this hypothesis, but this by itself is already predicted by multiple previous accounts 
(as the author notes in the Discussion) and is not new. 
Furthermore, the results are confounded by knowledge of solfege in the movable do system. 
It is unclear whether participants truly recalled scale degree 5 best within the melodies, 
or whether there were just more participants who knew the solfege name for scale degree 5 than the solfege names of other scale degrees.

2. The second hypothesis does not appear to be a hypothesis , but rather an exploration. 
This second hypothesis is too underdeveloped - e.g. Figure 3 is not sufficiently explained in the text.

3. There is not a specific comparison between the different note conditions (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 9 notes) in the text or in the figures.

4. The introduction is not sufficiently detailed. 
The authors state that in contrast to being very good at recognizing melodies, most people are not very good at learning melodies. 
This is an oversimplification and is not given careful enough treatment. 
For example the author could give a more comprehensive definition of recognition and learning, 
and do a more in-depth literature review about recognition and learning of melodies 
(e.g. include a more in-depth review of studies on learning and memory for melodies).

5. The discussion is a bit more detailed and interesting, but many ideas are introduced for the first time there (e.g. Marple’s 5-9 model).

6. The way the serial recall data is presented is not sufficiently detailed. Classically, serial recall task results are interesting because when you plot recall as a function of serial position, you observe primacy and recency effects. These are not touched on in the manuscript.
