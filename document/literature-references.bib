              recognize comparisons that were exact transpositions of the

    abstract = { Research in music perception has typically focused on common-practice music (tonal music from the Western European tradition, ca. 1750–1900) as a model of Western musical structure. However, recent research indicates that different styles within Western tonal music may follow distinct harmonic syntaxes. The current study investigated whether listeners can adapt their harmonic expectations when listening to different musical styles. In two experiments, listeners were presented with short musical excerpts that primed either rock or classical music, followed by a timbre-matched cadence. Results from both experiments indicated that listeners prefer V-I cadences over bVII-I cadences within a classical context, but that this preference is significantly diminished in a rock context. Our findings provide empirical support for the idea that different musical styles do employ different harmonic syntaxes. Furthermore, listeners are not only sensitive to these differences, but are able to adapt their expectations depending on the listening context. }

              listeners unfamiliar with the yoik style, the Western schematic
              model had most impact on Western listeners, and the

              Research with arrays of visual objects has shown how to
              distinguish the capacity, in terms of the number of objects
              retained, from the precision of the object representations. We
              adapt the technique to sequences of nonmusical tones, in an
              investigation including children (6-13 years, N = 84) and adults
              (26-50 years, N = 31). For each series of 1 to 4 tones, the
              participant responded by using an 80-choice scale to try to
              reproduce the tone at a queried serial position. Despite the much
              longer-lasting usefulness of sensory memory for tones compared
              with visual objects, the observed tone capacity was similar to
              previous findings for visual capacity. The results also constrain
              theories of childhood working memory development, indicating
              increases with age in both the capacity and the precision of the
              tone representations, similar to the visual studies, rather than
              age differences in time-based memory decay. The findings,
              including patterns of correlations between capacity, precision,
              and some auxiliary tasks and questionnaires, establish capacity
              and precision as dissociable processes and place important

              and unfamiliar melodies (i.e., the first note, then the first two
              notes, then the first three notes, and so forth). Recognition was
              assessed after each segment either by requiring participants to
              provide a familiarity judgment (Experiment 1) or by asking them
              to sing the melody that they thought had been presented
              (Experiment 2). In general, the more familiar the melody, the
              fewer the notes required for recognition. Musicians judged
              music's familiarity within fewer notes than did nonmusicians,
              whereas the reverse situation (i.e., musicians were slower than
              nonmusicians) occurred when a sung response was requested.
              However, both musicians and nonmusicians appeared to segment
              melodies into the same perceptual units (i.e., motives) in order
              to access the correct representation in memory. These results are
              interpreted in light of the cohort model (Marslen-Wilson, 1987),

  abstract = "The music of Richard Wagner tends to generate very diverse
              judgments indicative of the complex relationship between
              listeners and the sophisticated musical structures in Wagner's
              music. This paper presents ﬁndings from two listening experiments
              using the music from Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen that
              explores musical as well as individual listener parameters to
              better understand how listeners are able to hear leitmotives, a
              compositional device closely associated with Wagner's music.
              Results conﬁrm ﬁndings from a previous experiment showing that
              speciﬁc expertise with Wagner's music can account for a greater
              portion of the variance in an individual's ability to recognize
              and remember musical material compared to measures of generic
              musical training. Results also explore how acoustical distance of
              the leitmotives affects memory recognition using a chroma
              similarity measure. In addition, we show how characteristics of
              the compositional structure of the leitmotives contributes to
              their salience and memorability. A ﬁnal model is then presented
              that accounts for the aforementioned individual differences
              factors, as well as parameters of musical surface and structure.
              Our results suggest that that future work in music perception may
              consider both individual differences variables beyond musical
              training, as well as symbolic features and audio commonly used in

              musical skills and behaviours on multiple dimensions in the
              general population using a large Internet sample (n = 147,636).
              Thirdly, we report results from several lab studies,
              demonstrating that the Gold-MSI possesses good psychometric
              properties, and that self-reported musical sophistication is
              associated with performance on two listening tasks. Finally, we
              identify occupation, occupational status, age, gender, and wealth
              as the main socio-demographic factors associated with musical
              sophistication. Results are discussed in terms of theoretical
              accounts of implicit and statistical music learning and with
              regard to social conditions of sophisticated musical engagement.",

  abstract  = "A good book may have the power to change the way we see the
               world, but a great book actually becomes part of our daily
               consciousness, pervading our thinking to the point that we take
               it for granted, and we forget how provocative and challenging
               its ideas once were---and still are. The Structure of Scientific
               Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in
               1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of
               science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach.
               With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged
               long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing
               that transformative ideas don't arise from the day-to-day,
               gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but
               that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that
               disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur
               outside of ``normal science,'' as he called it. Though Kuhn was
               writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how
               scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass
               over time in research experiments are still instructive in our
               biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn's essential work in the
               history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian
               Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including
               paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn's ideas to the
               science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the
               book, Hacking's introduction provides important background
               information as well as a contemporary context. Newly designed,
               with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by
               the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history
               of our perspectives on science.",

              have yet to be integrated into mainstream psychological practice.
              This is unfortunate, because modern psychometric techniques can
              bring many benefits, including sophisticated reliability

              well-studied psychological capacity: melodic discrimination, the
              ability to detect differences between melodies. We calibrate and
              validate this test in a series of studies. Studies 1 and 2

  abstract = "Previous studies of auditory expectation have focused on the
              expectedness perceived by listeners retrospectively in response
              to events. In contrast, this research examines predictive
              uncertainty-a property of listeners' prospective state of
              expectation prior to the onset of an event. We examine the
              information-theoretic concept of Shannon entropy as a model of
              predictive uncertainty in music cognition. This is motivated by
              the Statistical Learning Hypothesis, which proposes that
              schematic expectations reflect probabilistic relationships
              between sensory events learned implicitly through exposure. Using
              probability estimates from an unsupervised, variable-order Markov
              model, 12 melodic contexts high in entropy and 12 melodic
              contexts low in entropy were selected from two musical
              repertoires differing in structural complexity (simple and
              complex). Musicians and non-musicians listened to the stimuli and
              provided explicit judgments of perceived uncertainty (explicit
              uncertainty). We also examined an indirect measure of uncertainty
              computed as the entropy of expectedness distributions obtained
              using a classical probe-tone paradigm where listeners rated the
              perceived expectedness of the final note in a melodic sequence
              (inferred uncertainty). Finally, we simulate listeners'
              perception of expectedness and uncertainty using computational
              models of auditory expectation. A detailed model comparison
              indicates which model parameters maximize fit to the data and how
              they compare to existing models in the literature. The results
              show that listeners experience greater uncertainty in
              high-entropy musical contexts than low-entropy contexts. This
              effect is particularly apparent for inferred uncertainty and is
              stronger in musicians than non-musicians. Consistent with the
              Statistical Learning Hypothesis, the results suggest that
              increased domain-relevant training is associated with an

  author   = "Omigie, Diana and Pearce, Marcus T and Stewart, Lauren",
  abstract = "Auditory perception involves not only hearing a series of sounds
              but also making predictions about future ones. For typical
              listeners, these predictions are formed on the basis of long-term
              schematic knowledge, gained over a lifetime of exposure to the
              auditory environment. Individuals with a developmental disorder
              known as congenital amusia show marked difficulties with music
              perception and production. The current study investigated whether
              these difficulties can be explained, either by a failure to
              internalise the statistical regularities present in music, or by
              a failure to consciously access this information. Two versions of
              a melodic priming paradigm were used to probe participants'
              abilities to form melodic pitch expectations, in an implicit and
              an explicit manner. In the implicit version (Experiment 1),
              participants made speeded, forced-choice discriminations
              concerning the timbre of a cued target note. In the explicit
              version (Experiment 2), participants used a 1-7 rating scale to
              indicate the degree to which the pitch of the cued target note
              was expected or unexpected. Target notes were chosen to have high
              or low probability in the context of the melody, based on the
              predictions of a computational model of melodic expectation.
              Analysis of the data from the implicit task revealed a melodic
              priming effect in both amusic and control participants whereby
              both groups showed faster responses to high probability than low
              probability notes rendered in the same timbre as the context.
              However, analysis of the data from the explicit task revealed
              that amusic participants were significantly worse than controls
              at using explicit ratings to differentiate between high and low
              probability events in a melodic context. Taken together, findings
              from the current study make an important contribution in
              demonstrating that amusic individuals track melodic pitch
              probabilities at an implicit level despite an impairment,
              relative to controls, when required to make explicit judgments in
              this regard. However the unexpected finding that amusics
              nevertheless are able to use explicit ratings to distinguish
              between high and low probability notes (albeit not as well as
              controls) makes a similarly important contribution in revealing a
              sensitivity to musical structure that has not previously been
              demonstrated in these individuals.",

              a more controlled stimulus set and a 2-alternative forced choice
              (Experiment 1) or same/different test (Experiment 2) instead of a
              dictation or singing-back task. Nonmusicians listened to a total
              of 158 isochronous 5-tone melodies. Each melody was followed by a
              same-length retention interval filled with silence, nonsense
              syllables, a nondiatonic melody, or a diatonic melody, and a
              subsequent test with same-contour lures. In both experiments and
              across all conditions listeners showed above-chance short-term
              recognition performance. We replicated Taylor \& Pembrook's
              recency effect for the 5th note of the sequences but also found a
              full J-shaped serial position curve (recency>primacy>center).
              Secondly, listeners performed better for tone sequences that were
              either fully ascending or descending than those with melodic
              direction changes. Thirdly, listeners were better in noticing a
              changed note that occurred at a point of melodic direction change
              (e. g., {\`U} or {\'U}). In Experiment 1 but not 2, we
              furthermore found that this ``corner note effect'' was even more
              pronounced if that note was preceded by a ``skip'' (3 or more
              semitones) instead of a ``step'' (2 or less semitones) pitch
              interval. The latter finding was somewhat similar to Taylor and
              Pembrook's finding that listeners were more accurate in their
              reproduction of skip as opposed to step intervals when they
              marked a point of change in melodic direction. Fourthly, type of
              retention interval had a major effect on participants'
              performances. When tested with a 2AFC setup, the silence group
              performed best, when tested with a same/different setup, both the
              silence and nonsense syllable groups performed best. Results are

              between the first and second presentation of an object is
              observed as the number of intervening items increases. However,
              this effect is not universal. Within the auditory domain, this
              form of interference has been demonstrated in word and
              single-note recognition, but has yet to be substantiated using
              relatively complex musical material such as a melody. Indeed, it
              is becoming clear that music shows intriguing properties when it
              comes to memory. This study investigated how the number of
              intervening items influences memory for melodies. In Experiments
              1, 2 and 3, one melody was presented per trial in a continuous
              recognition paradigm. After each melody, participants indicated
              whether they had heard the melody in the experiment before by
              responding ``old'' or ``new.'' In Experiment 4, participants
              rated perceived familiarity for every melody without being told
              that melodies reoccur. In four experiments using two corpora of
              music, two different memory tasks, transposed and untransposed
              melodies and up to 195 intervening melodies, no sign of a
              disruptive effect from the number of intervening melodies beyond
              the first was observed. We propose a new ``regenerative multiple
              representations'' conjecture to explain why intervening items
              increase interference in recognition memory for most domains but
              not music. This conjecture makes several testable predictions and
              has the potential to strengthen our understanding of domain
              specificity in human memory, while moving one step closer to
              explaining the ``paradox'' that is memory for melody.",

               brain'' makes more sense with reference to working memory, which
               is the limited amount of information a person can hold

               completion of almost any challenging cognitive task. This
               groundbreaking book explains the evidence supporting Cowan's
               theoretical proposal about working memory capacity, and compares
               it to competing perspectives. Cognitive psychologists profoundly
               disagree on how working memory is limited: whether by the number
               of units that can be retained (and, if so, what kind of units
               and how many?), the types of interfering material, the time that
               has elapsed, some combination of these mechanisms, or none of

               biological, cognitive, and evolutionary accounts. The book
               concludes with a discussion of the practical importance of

              tunes that were named as INMI by 3,000 survey participants. It
              was found that songs that had achieved greater success and more
              recent runs in the UK Music Charts were reported more frequently
              as INMI. A set of 100 of these frequently-named INMI tunes were
              then matched to 100 tunes never named as INMI by the survey
              participants, in terms of popularity and song style. These two

               learning tasks were employed throughout, with memory performance
               assessed by forced-choice recognition, recall measures or choice
               reaction-time tasks. The main experimental findings were: (1)
               memory capacity, as a function of the amount of material
               presented, follows a general power law with a characteristic
               exponent for each task; (2) pictorial material obeys this power
               law and shows an overall superiority to verbal material. The
               capacity of recognition memory for pictures is almost limitless,
               when measured under appropriate conditions; (3) when the
               recognition task is made harder by using more alternatives,
               memory capacity stays constant and the superiority of pictures
               is maintained; (4) picture memory also exceeds verbal memory in
               terms of verbal recall; comparable recognition/recall ratios are
               obtained for pictures, words and nonsense syllables; (5) verbal
               memory shows a higher retrieval speed than picture memory, as
               inferred from reaction-time measures. Both types of material
               obey a power law, when reaction-time is measured for various
               sizes of learning set, and both show very rapid rates of memory
               search. From a consideration of the experimental results and
               other data it is concluded that the superiority of the pictorial
               mode in recognition and free recall learning tasks is well
               established and cannot be attributed to methodological artifact.

              preference ratings. In Experiment 1, participants were presented
              with 15 melodies 27 times each. Forced choice results showed that
              participants were able to recognize previously encountered
              melodies and generalize their knowledge to new melodies,

  abstract = "Instantaneous consonance is a salient perceptual phenomenon
              corresponding to the perceived pleasantness of simultaneously
              sounding musical notes. Various competing theories of consonance
              have been proposed over the centuries, but recently a consensus
              has developed that consonance is primarily driven by periodicity
              perception. Here we question this view, substantiating our
              argument by critically reviewing historic consonance research
              from a broad variety of disciplines, re-analyzing consonance
              perception data from four previous behavioral studies
              representing more than 500 participants, and modeling three
              Western musical corpora representing more than 100,000
              compositions. We conclude that consonance is a composite
              phenomenon that derives in large part from three phenomena:
              spectral interference, periodicity, and cultural familiarity. We
              formalize this conclusion with a computational model that
              predicts a musical chord's perceptual consonance from these three
              features, and release this model in an open-source R package,
              incon, alongside 15 other computational models also evaluated in

  abstract = "Working memory (WM) capacity limit has been extensively studied
              in the domains of visual and verbal stimuli. Previous studies
              have suggested a fixed WM capacity of typically about three or
              four items, on the basis of the number of items in working memory
              reaching a plateau after several items as the set size increases.
              However, the fixed WM capacity estimate appears to rely on
              categorical information in the stimulus set (Olsson \& Poom
              Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 102:8776-8780,
              2005). We designed a series of experiments to investigate
              nonverbal auditory WM capacity and its dependence on categorical
              information. Experiments 1 and 2 used simple tones and revealed
              capacity limit of up to two tones following a 6-s retention
              interval. Importantly, performance was significantly higher at
              set sizes 2, 3, and 4 when the frequency difference between
              target and test tones was relatively large. In Experiment 3, we
              added categorical information to the simple tones, and the effect
              of tone change magnitude decreased. Maximal capacity for each
              individual was just over three sounds, in the range of typical
              visual procedures. We propose that two types of information,
              categorical and detailed acoustic information, are kept in WM and
              that categorical information is critical for high WM performance.",

              evolutionary advantages, and predictive successes or failures
              often entail significant psychological and physiological
              consequences. In music perception, the confirmation and violation
              of expectations are critical to the communication of emotion and
              aesthetic effects of a composition. Neuroscientific research on
              musical expectations has focused on harmony. Although harmony is
              important in Western tonal styles, other musical traditions,
              emphasizing pitch and melody, have been rather neglected. In this
              study, we investigated melodic pitch expectations elicited by
              ecologically valid musical stimuli by drawing together
              computational, behavioural, and electrophysiological evidence.
              Unlike rule-based models, our computational model acquires
              knowledge through unsupervised statistical learning of sequential
              structure in music and uses this knowledge to estimate the
              conditional probability (and information content) of musical
              notes. Unlike previous behavioural paradigms that interrupt a
              stimulus, we devised a new paradigm for studying auditory
              expectation without compromising ecological validity. A strong
              negative correlation was found between the probability of notes
              predicted by our model and the subjectively perceived degree of
              expectedness. Our electrophysiological results showed that
              low-probability notes, as compared to high-probability notes,
              elicited a larger (i) negative ERP component at a late time
              period (400-450 ms), (ii) beta band (14-30 Hz) oscillation over
              the parietal lobe, and (iii) long-range phase synchronization
              between multiple brain regions. Altogether, the study
              demonstrated that statistical learning produces
              information-theoretic descriptions of musical notes that are
              proportional to their perceived expectedness and are associated

              model of perceptual segmentation to test the hypothesis. Although

              principle to sequential grouping in other areas of cognition.
              Second, we address a methodological consideration in the analysis
              of ambiguous stimuli that produce different percepts between
              individuals. We propose and demonstrate a solution to this

              undergraduate music majors completed short tonal melodic
              dictations in a within-subjects design with three conditions: (a)
              no specified strategy in the instructions, (b) required listening
              before writing, and (c) required writing while listening. The
              purpose of the first condition was to determine subjects'
              preference for listening before writing or writing while
              listening prior to requiring each. Two repeated measures t tests
              revealed no significant difference in test scores between the
              second and third conditions and no significant difference in test
              scores between subjects' demonstrated preferred strategy and
              nonpreferred strategy. Results corroborate prior research

  author   = "Baker, David John",
  abstract = "Melodic dictation is a cognitively demanding process that
              requires students to hear a melody, then without any access to an
              external reference, transcribe the melody within a limited time
              frame. Despite its ubiquity in curricula within School of Music
              settings, exactly how an individual learns a melody is not well
              understood. This dissertation aims to fill the gap in the
              literature between aural skills practitioners and music
              psychologists in order to reach conclusions that can be applied
              systematically in pedagogical contexts. In order to do this, I
              synthesize literature from music theory, music psychology, and
              music education in order to demonstrate how tools from both
              cognitive psychology as well as computational musicology can be
              used to help inform pedagogical practices. In the second chapter,
              I discuss factors that might play a role in a student's ability
              to take melodic dictation and put forward a taxonomy of factors
              that are assumed to contribute to an individual's ability to take
              melodic dictation. The third chapter of the dissertation
              investigates individual factors that are theorized to contribute
              to melodic dictation using a cross-sectional experimental design.
              The chapter corroborates claims on the importance of
              understanding individual differences in working memory capacity
              in research on melodic dictation. The fourth chapter discusses
              how aural skills pedagogy can incorporate methodologies from
              computational musicology in order to inform teaching practice. In
              my fifth chapter, I introduce the MeloSol corpus, a new
              collection of 783 digitized melodies encoded in the **kern
              format. In the sixth chapter, I synthesize the previous research
              in a melodic dictation experiment to show how using robust
              statistical methods can be used model melodic dictation. Finally,
              in my seventh chapter, I introduce a computational, cognitive
              model of melodic dictation with the goal of helping explain how
              students improve at melodic dictation. I demonstrate how modeling
              the cognitive decision process during melodic dictation helps
              provide a precise framework for pedagogues to understand
              student's inner cognition during melodic dictation and can help
              inform teaching practice.",

              by asking participants to make judgments about the recency and
              frequency of presentation of melodies over the course of two days
              of testing. For novel melodies, recency judgments were poor and
              participants often confused the number of presentations of a
              melody with its day of presentation; melodies heard frequently
              were judged as have been heard more recently than they actually
              were. For familiar melodies, recency judgments were much more
              accurate and the number of presentations of a melody helped
              rather than hindered performance. Frequency judgments were
              generally more accurate than recency judgments and did not
              demonstrate the same interaction with musical familiarity.
              Overall, these ﬁndings suggest that (1) episodic recognition of
              novel melodies is based more on a generalized ``feeling of
              familiarity'' than on a speciﬁc episodic memory, (2) frequency
              information contributes more strongly to this generalized memory
              than recency information, and (3) the formation of an episodic
              memory for a melody depends either on the overall familiarity of
              the stimulus or the availability of a verbal label.",

              instrument). We examined the duration of memory for melodies
              (tunes) and whether such memory is affected by changes in key,
              tempo, or timbre. After listening to previously unfamiliar
              melodies twice, participants provided recognition ratings for the
              same (old) melodies as well as for an equal number of new
              melodies. The delay between initial exposure and test was 10 min,
              1 day, or 1 week. In Experiment 1, half of the old melodies were
              transposed by six semitones or shifted in tempo by 64 beats per
              minute. In Experiment 2, half of the old melodies were changed in
              timbre (piano to saxophone, or vice versa). In both experiments,
              listeners remembered the melodies, and there was no forgetting
              over the course of a week. Changing the key or tempo from
              exposure to test had a detrimental impact on recognition after 10
              min and 1 day, but not after 1 week. Changing the timbre affected
              recognition negatively after all three delays. Mental
              representations of unfamiliar melodies appear to be consolidated
              after only two presentations. These representations include

              audience response system developed for this purpose, we measured
              subjective experience and peripheral psychophysiological changes
              continuously. To confirm the existence of the link between
              expectation and emotion, we used a threefold approach. (1) On the
              basis of an information-theoretic cognitive model, melodic pitch
              expectations were predicted by analyzing the musical stimuli used
              (six pieces of solo flute music). (2) A continuous rating scale
              was used by half of the audience to measure their experience of
              unexpectedness toward the music heard. (3) Emotional reactions
              were measured using a multicomponent approach: subjective feeling
              (valence and arousal rated continuously by the other half of the
              audience members), expressive behavior (facial EMG), and
              peripheral arousal (the latter two being measured in all 50
              participants). Results confirmed the predicted relationship
              between high-information-content musical events, the violation of
              musical expectations (in corresponding ratings), and emotional
              reactions (psychologically and physiologically). Musical
              structures leading to expectation reactions were manifested in
              emotional reactions at different emotion component levels
              (increases in subjective arousal and autonomic nervous system
              activations). These results emphasize the role of musical

               research since the similarity between (parts of) musical pieces
               determines perception of stylistic categories and structural
               relationships between parts of musical works. The purpose of the
               present research is to develop and test models of musical
               similarity perception inspired by a transformational approach
               which conceives of similarity between two perceptual objects in
               terms of the complexity of the cognitive operations required to
               transform the representation of the first object into that of
               the second, a process which has been formulated in
               information-theoretic terms. Specifically, computational
               simulations are developed based on compression distance in which
               a probabilistic model is trained on one piece of music and then
               used to predict, or compress, the notes in a second piece. The
               more predictable the second piece according to the model, the
               more efficiently it can be encoded and the greater the
               similarity between the two pieces. The present research extends
               an existing information-theoretic model of auditory expectation
               (IDyOM) to compute compression distances varying in symmetry and
               normalisation using high-level symbolic features representing
               aspects of pitch and rhythmic structure. Comparing these
               compression distances with listeners? similarity ratings between
               pairs of melodies collected in three experiments demonstrates
               that the compression-based model provides a good fit to the data
               and allows the identification of representations, model
               parameters and compression-based metrics that best account for
               musical similarity perception. The compression-based model also
               shows comparable performance to the best-performing algorithms

              disease (AD) patients on recognition memory for tunes. In
              Experiment 1, AD patients and age-matched controls received a
              study list and an old/new recognition test of highly familiar,
              traditional tunes, followed by a study list and test of novel
              tunes. The controls performed better than did the AD patients.
              The controls showed the ``mirror effect'' of increased hits and
              reduced false alarms for traditional versus novel tunes, whereas
              the patients false-alarmed as often to traditional tunes as to
              novel tunes. Experiment 2 compared young adults and healthy
              elderly persons using a similar design. Performance was lower in
              the elderly group, but both younger and older subjects showed the
              mirror effect. Experiment 3 produced confusion between
              preexperimental familiarity and intraexperimental familiarity by
              mixing traditional and novel tunes in the study lists and tests.
              Here, the subjects in both age groups resembled the patients of
              Experiment 1 in failing to show the mirror effect. Older subjects
              again performed more poorly, and they differed qualitatively from
              younger subjects in setting stricter criteria for more nameable
              tunes. Distinguishing different sources of global familiarity is
              a factor in tune recognition, and the data suggest that this type
              of source monitoring is impaired in AD and involves different
